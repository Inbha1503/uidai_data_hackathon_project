# UIDAI Aadhaar Enrolment Analytics (Hackathon Project)

This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment trends across districts in Tamil Nadu using government open data.
The analysis was developed as part of a data analytics hackathon to uncover demographic and regional enrolment patterns.

## Objectives
- Analyze Aadhaar enrolment trends over time
- Compare enrolment across districts and age groups
- Identify high and low enrolment regions
- Support data-driven public policy insights

## Dataset
- Source: UIDAI Open Government Data
- Scope: District-level Aadhaar enrolment data for Tamil Nadu
- Time Period: 2025–2026

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning and Preparation using Python (Pandas)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Age-wise and district-wise trend analysis
- Interactive dashboard creation using Power BI

## Key Insights
- Aadhaar enrolment is concentrated in urban and high-population districts
- The 18+ age group accounts for the majority of enrolments
